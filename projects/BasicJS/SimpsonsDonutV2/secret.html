However, when Homer leaves, it starts raining donuts. (Homer often panics when they are out of donuts.)</p>
    <p>In another Treehouse of Horror episode, Homer sells his soul for one.<br>Marge wins the court case and Homer keeps his soul but his head is turned into a donut by Ned Flanders.<br>In the show they usually have pink frosting with multicolor sprinkles. <a href="http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Donuts">#REF</a></p>
